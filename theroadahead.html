    <p class="Text1">Whilst finishing his contract at Hopwood Hall college Scott began to plan, to search for an opportunity which would allow him to grow, to learn, to adapt and after several weeks, he found tech.
    <br>
     Scott was no stranger to technology both hardware and software, he utilized both daily, whether for work of leaser time. He would regularly play  the role of tech support and become obsessed with fixing an issue with technology himself. Often times he would copy and paste varous code into terminals for devices in order to fix an issue, without truly understanding its’ meaning. 
    <br>    
    Over Christmas, Scott was setting up several devices and was rambling to himself about how he would change the accessibility and user interface, if only he knew how. With that he opened up his MacBook and began searching for jobs in tech, coding, testing, game design, web development. After a week of deciphering the roles and what was available, Scott began looking for courses in tech. It was then that he first saw an advertisement for Code Nation.
    <br>    
    Code Nation is an accredited training provider of tech based qualifications, from simple Coding Languages to Cyber security and beyond. Scott enroled onto the course without hesitation. He received fantastic levels of support and teaching which allowed him to create a text based aventure game using Python and of course use HTML to create this very website.
    <br>    
    The game is named ‘RELIC HUNTER’ a simpe yet entertaining game consisting of a professional artifact thief who is attempting to penetrate an ancienttomb in search of it’s hidden treasures.

With the tools that he has learned recently he will continue to sharpen and hone his skills and continue to build his portfolio.</p>
