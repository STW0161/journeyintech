        THE ROAD TRAVELED</h2>

<p class="intropara">Let's catch you up! before you try to understand where Scott is going, you must first get an idea of where he has come from.</p>

    <p class="Text1">After leaving Salford College in a blaze of glory, holding 2 distinction level 3 diplomas Scotts' sights were on Wales, where he studied Zoological Science at Bangor University. 
    <br>
    Whilst in Wales Scott wasted no time in getting active, climbing Mt Snowden, Scuba diving in the nearby beaches and of course searching for wildlife, he was a student of zoology after all. He also sampled some of the local bars and pubs…on occasion...
    <br>
    <br>
    Both during and after university Scott embarked on several field trips and leisurely travel to a variety of destinations.  Some of his favourites included; studying rattlesnakes in the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, Collecting Gallotia Lizards in Tenerife to compare their colouration and his fieldwork in African rift valley. During this time Scott set up camp by an inactive volcanic crator which, after thousands of years, had filled with water and was now a very peculiar lake called Massoko. However there is much too much to discuss about this particular rip here.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fortunatley Scott documented his fieldowkr in Tanzania by making a short documentary which you can watch here.
    <br>
    <br>
    After leaving University Scott began to work at Blackpool Zoo where he was an animal keeper for variety of animals, including Giraffes, Elephants and his personal favourate, Reptiles. 
    <br>
    <br>
    With several years of working in various zoos, aquariums and other animal collections Scott found himself working in the Education section of a local zoo, which sparked a passion for education and teaching.
    <br>
    <br>
    So, which his new challenge in mind, he set his sighs immediately on teaching Animal Science and Animal Management by using his free time to volunteer at local colleges whilst completing a PGCE. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Before completing his PGCE Scott was snatchd up for a full time contract at the Manchester College, however Scott’s eyes were set on teaching at the college that he himself studied at in Salford, and so it was after a few years he did just that. 
    <br>
    <br>
    5 years of teaching and a global pandemic later, Scott found himself exploring new and exciting opportunities in other areas. 14 years of working with animals had treated him very well but the winds had changed and they carried with them a new goal. </p>
