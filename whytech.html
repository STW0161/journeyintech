        WHY TECH?</h2>

    <p class="intropara">I hope you enjoyed the laboured 3rd person narrative of the first few pages, in this section I’ll be referring myself in the first person and offering some insight into why I belive that the tech industry has drawn my attention over the past few months. </p>
    <br>

    <p  class="Text1">First and foremost, I am at heart, a technology enthusiast, I regularly keep up to date with keynote speakers and try to keep up with modern advances in technology. 
    <br>
    In addition, ifyou have read the past few pages you will have noticed my fieldwork. Whilst enjoyable, it involved heavy amounts of statistical analysis and genetic coding. Which shares very vague similarities with computer coding language. It requires a similar amount of dedication to learn and can never truly be mastered, which is a possative in my opinion. An ever changing, ever learning industry makes for a never boring industry.
    <br>    
    I’d be interested in starting in quality assurance or testing in order to gain a further insight into the front end aspects of products and projects. I belive that this will allow for additional time spent learning and developing those desired skills. I’m an ambitious individual who cannot simply work in a role which has no progression or ever changing challenge. 
    <br>    
    I will not turn this page into a CV, however I would like to add that teaching provides a huge variety of of employable skills, such as ; leadership skills, team work, time keeping, organisation, communication and creation of resources, just to name a few. These are skills that i believe would transfer very well to a rle in the tech industry. Perhaps the most important in my personal opppinion is, peer review, observation and reflection a trinity of invaluable skills when woring in a successful team.
    <br>    
    If you’d like to get in touch to discuss any of the information on this site, please do! Even if it’s just to ask me about what pet you should buy next, I’ll be very supportive I assure you!
    <br>    
    Or of course to discuss starting roles in the tech industry.
